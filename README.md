Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.

You'll start the game by SELECTING an image for YOUR PLAYER character.

The goal is to get the player to reach the water within 30 seconds (see TIMING), as many times as you can by 
reaching highest score.  

At start the Player is shown on the greengrass in the middle at the starting square.
The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in
varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a player collides with an enemy, 
the player will be moved back to starting square and loose points. Once the player reaches the water will be moved back to starting square and within your timeframe you can move it again to water.
Your player can collect gems that are thrown on the paved block for extra points (see below SCORING).


TIMING
You have only 30 seconds to move one Player from the green zone to reach the water.
Time is monitored and remaining seconds displayed at the top of the screen 
right under SCORE.


SCORING
Your score is displayed at the top of the screen throughout the game. Points
accumulate as follows:
Successfully jumping Player without 
jumping off screen 10 points per jump
Successfully jumping Player to reach the water  500 points
COLLECTING A GEM 200 points
Colliding with an enemy -100 points

Enjoy the game as I enjoyed coding it!
