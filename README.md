Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.

You'll start the game by SELECTING an image for YOUR PLAYER character.

At start you have 5 Players. The goal is to get the player one at a time to reach the water within 30 seconds (see TIMING), without
colliding into any one of the enemies (bugs) .  
The first Player is shown on the greengrass in the middle at the starting square.
The remaining Players are shown on the lower lefthand corner of the screen.

The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in
varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a player collides with an enemy, 
the player will be moved back to starting square and loose points. Once the player reaches the water will be moved back to starting square and within your timeframe you can move it again to water.
Your player can collect gems that are thrown on the paved block for extra points (see below SCORING).
Once all 5 Players reached the water the game is won.

TIMING
You have only 30 seconds to move one Player from the green zone to reach the water.
Time is monitored and remaining seconds displayed at the top of the screen 
right under SCORE.

If you run out of time before you get Player to water, you'll lose him.


SCORING
Your score is displayed at the top of the screen throughout the game. Points
accumulate as follows:
Successfully jumping Player without 
jumping off screen 10 points per jump
Successfully jumping Player to reach the water  500 points
Successfully jumping 5 Players to reach the water 1000 points
COLLECTING A GEM 200 points
Colliding with an enemy -50 points

Every time you score 10,000 points and have fewer than 4 Players left, you'll get
another Player!
